# Obsidian Plugin Template

This template repo is intended to back most of my Obsidian plugins. It is a fork of [Obsidian Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin).

### Excerpts from the original README.md:

This is a sample plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

This project uses Typescript to provide type checking and documentation.
The repo depends on the latest plugin API (obsidian.d.ts) in Typescript Definition format, which contains TSDoc comments describing what it does.

### Changes by me:

1. Getting started guide from original _README.md_ is now in [[GUIDE.md]]
1. Replaced `npm` with `pnpm`.
3. Turned hoisting off for all packages. Experimental and may have to allow for some packages later.
4. Personalized manifest.json.
